My second ever python project. I tried my hand at making a little stream overlay for my friend Weissandchill for Weiss Schwarz that displays the Playername, current Clock and Level of the players and which sets they are playing. This is also the first time I've ever used tkinter, so don't expect too much please.

Do not remove any of the folders/files and do not move the .exe into a different folder, the program will not wortk.

The function that loads the hexagonal card image only works for cards that exist in the card database on the official japanese Weiss Schwarz website.
Why doesn't the english site work? 
Cuz the english website sucks. :)

Why are there 2 separate "New Game" buttons, 1 for each player?
Cuz this is the first time I've worked with classes in python and I couldn't work out how to reset with a single button, so I put the "New Game" button into the same class as each player.
If you know how I could do that please let me know and I'll try to update the Overlay.

The Shiyoko image is a placeholder until the user inputs a valid card code to load. Should the loading fail the program will default back to the Shiyoko.
I did not test every single image in the japanese card database, but the load should work if you input a valid card code. The exception might be some random very old cards.
If you encounter any problems please let me know.
